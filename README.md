# Deno Module for CICD
Check whether this can be developed in the context of the [Deno Hacktoberfest](https://organize.mlh.io/participants/events/5363-nest-land-hacktoberfest-online-meetup-with-ryan-dahl-sam-williams-and-michael-spengler) and later on moved to: https://github.com/sap (check with OSPO) and published on Deno.land and Nest.land.  

Check existing CICD processes for projects in https://github.com/sap and validate whether some standardization / modernization might be valuable.
